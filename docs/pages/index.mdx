# Introduction

This repository serves as the centralized infrastructure for a HomeLab setup, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure consistency, scalability, and automation. The infrastructure is meticulously managed through a combination of **Ansible** for configuration management and **Terraform** for provisioning and managing resources across multiple cloud platforms, including **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Cloudflare**, and **Hetzner Cloud**.

In addition to managing infrastructure, this setup incorporates **Zero Trust Networking** through **Twingate**, implemented via Terraform, to enhance security by ensuring that access to resources is tightly controlled and monitored.

## Initiative

The primary initiative behind this project is to streamline and automate the management of HomeLab infrastructure, eliminating manual configurations and reducing the risk of errors. By centralizing everything within a Git repository, it becomes easier to track changes, roll back configurations, and collaborate effectively. The integration of multiple cloud providers ensures that resources can be managed seamlessly across different environments, while the use of Zero Trust Networking aligns with modern security practices to safeguard sensitive data and services. This setup aims to be both a learning tool and a robust, real-world infrastructure model for managing a diverse set of resources securely and efficiently.
